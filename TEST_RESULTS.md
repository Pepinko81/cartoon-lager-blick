## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Hardcoded URLs in Backend Routes ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Backend routes for floorplan and logos used hardcoded `http://lager.local:5000` URLs  
**Files**: `backend/routes/floorplan.js`, `backend/routes/logos.js`  
**Fix**: Changed to use dynamic base URL from request (`req.protocol` and `req.get('host')`)  
**Status**: Fixed

### Issue 2: Logo URL Format in API ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend API functions might need to handle different URL formats  
**Files**: `src/api/warehouse.ts`  
**Fix**: Added URL normalization logic to handle:
  - Full URLs (starts with 'http')
  - Relative URLs starting with '/'
  - Filename-only URLs (prepend `/logos/` or `/floorplans/`)
**Status**: Fixed

### Issue 3: Potential Null Reference in Rack3D ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Using non-null assertion operator (`!`) on potentially null `logoConfig`  
**Files**: `src/components/warehouse/Rack3D.tsx`  
**Fix**: Added null check before spreading logoConfig  
**Status**: Fixed

### Issue 4: Token Key Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: API functions in `warehouse.ts` used `"authToken"` but AuthContext stores token as `"lager_token"`  
**Files**: `src/api/warehouse.ts`  
**Fix**: Changed `localStorage.getItem("authToken")` to `localStorage.getItem("lager_token")`  
**Status**: Fixed - This resolves 401 Unauthorized errors in API calls

### Console Errors/Warnings (After Fix)
- ✅ No more 401 Unauthorized errors after token key fix
- ⚠️ WebGL Context Lost warnings (normal during view switching)
- ⚠️ Font-related debug messages (non-critical)
- ⚠️ 404 errors for missing floor plan/logo (expected when no files uploaded)

## Remaining Tests Needed (Requires Manual File Upload)

1. **Floor Plan Upload**: Upload test image file via browser UI
2. **Logo Upload**: Upload test logo file via browser UI  
3. **3D Logo Positioning**: Test raycaster interaction after logo upload
4. **Map Rack Dragging**: Test drag and drop on map with zoom/pan (manual interaction)
5. **Position Persistence**: Verify positions save to database after drag
6. **Static File Serving**: Verify uploaded files are accessible via URLs

## Summary

### Issues Found and Fixed: 4
1. ✅ Hardcoded URLs in backend routes - Fixed with dynamic URL generation
2. ✅ URL format handling in API - Fixed with normalization logic
3. ✅ Null reference potential in Rack3D - Fixed with proper null checks
4. ✅ Token key mismatch - Fixed localStorage key from "authToken" to "lager_token"

### Testing Results Summary

#### Backend Infrastructure ✅
- ✅ Database migration: position_x, position_y columns added successfully
- ✅ New tables created: warehouse_floor_plan, branding_logos
- ✅ Directories created: floorplans/, logos/
- ✅ Backend server running and responding to health check

#### Code Quality ✅
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ TypeScript types correctly defined
- ✅ All imports resolved
- ✅ 3 issues found and fixed:
  1. Hardcoded URLs → Dynamic URL generation
  2. URL format handling → Normalization logic
  3. Null reference potential → Proper null checks

#### Runtime Testing Required
The following require manual testing in browser with authentication:
- Floor plan upload/delete operations
- Logo upload/positioning operations
- Map view with drag and drop
- 3D logo positioning with raycaster
- Static file serving verification

### Next Steps for Full Testing
1. Start backend server: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start frontend server: `npm run dev`
3. Test each functionality manually in browser
4. Check browser console for runtime errors
5. Test on mobile devices for touch interactions
