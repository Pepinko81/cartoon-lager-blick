## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Hardcoded URLs in Backend Routes ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Backend routes for floorplan and logos used hardcoded `http://lager.local:5000` URLs  
**Files**: `backend/routes/floorplan.js`, `backend/routes/logos.js`  
**Fix**: Changed to use dynamic base URL from request (`req.protocol` and `req.get('host')`)  
**Status**: Fixed

### Issue 2: Logo URL Format in API ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend API functions might need to handle different URL formats  
**Files**: `src/api/warehouse.ts`  
**Fix**: Added URL normalization logic to handle:
  - Full URLs (starts with 'http')
  - Relative URLs starting with '/'
  - Filename-only URLs (prepend `/logos/` or `/floorplans/`)
**Status**: Fixed

### Issue 3: Potential Null Reference in Rack3D ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Using non-null assertion operator (`!`) on potentially null `logoConfig`  
**Files**: `src/components/warehouse/Rack3D.tsx`  
**Fix**: Added null check before spreading logoConfig  
**Status**: Fixed

### Issue 4: Token Key Mismatch ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: API functions in `warehouse.ts` used `"authToken"` but AuthContext stores token as `"lager_token"`  
**Files**: `src/api/warehouse.ts`  
**Fix**: Changed `localStorage.getItem("authToken")` to `localStorage.getItem("lager_token")`  
**Status**: Fixed - This resolves 401 Unauthorized errors in API calls
